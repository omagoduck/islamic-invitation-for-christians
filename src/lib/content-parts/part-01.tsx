This message is not written to attack you.
It is not written to insult your faith.
And it is not written to take away what you love.

It is written because you love Jesus, and so do we.

Muslims do not see Jesus as an enemy.
We do not curse him.
We do not reject him.

We honor him.
We love him.
We believe in his miracles.
We believe in his purity.
We believe in his birth without a father.
We believe he will return.

And that is why this conversation matters.

Because the question is not:
"Who loves Jesus more?"

The question is:
Who understood his message as he meant it?

## Before Christianity Existed

Before there was a church…
Before there was a Bible in its current form…
Before there were doctrines and councils…

There was Jesus, walking the land of Palestine.

He prayed.
He fasted.
He bowed his head.
He spoke of God as greater than himself.
He called people to worship One God.

He did not speak Greek.
He did not teach philosophy.
He did not tell people to worship him.

He said things like:

> "The Father is greater than I."
> "I can do nothing by myself."
> "I seek not my own will, but the will of Him who sent me."

These are not the words of God speaking as God.
These are the words of a servant speaking about God.

And this is exactly how Islam understands Jesus:
a messenger sent by God, not God Himself.

## What Islam Says About Jesus

Islam does not come to erase Jesus.
Islam comes to restore him.

The Quran says:

> "The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah…" (4:171)

It says:
- He was born miraculously
- He healed the sick by God's permission
- He raised the dead by God's permission
- He spoke the truth
- He never claimed divinity

And most importantly:

> "They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him — but it was made to appear so." (4:157)

In Islam, God does not abandon His prophets.
God does not allow His chosen messenger to be humiliated and executed by his enemies.

Instead, God raised Jesus up — and Jesus will return.

## So Where Did Christianity Change?

This is the most important part.

After Jesus was raised, his true followers were few.
They were poor.
They were hunted.
They had no political power.

Then came Paul.

Paul never met Jesus.
Paul was not taught by Jesus.
Yet Paul became the most influential figure in Christianity.

He changed three major things:

### He removed the Law

Jesus followed the Law of Moses.

Paul said the Law was no longer needed.

### He introduced divine sonship

Jesus said: "I worship God."

Paul said: "Jesus is the Son of God who died for sins."

### He redefined salvation

Jesus taught obedience.

Paul taught belief in the crucifixion.

Later, when Christianity entered the Roman Empire, things changed even more.

Romans were used to:
- gods with sons
- divine men
- trinities

So Christianity slowly adapted.

Then came the Council of Nicaea (325 CE).

This was not a spiritual meeting.
It was a political one.

People argued:
"Is Jesus God or a servant of God?"

The side supported by the Roman emperor won.
The other side was declared heresy.
Their books were destroyed.
Their followers were hunted.

From that moment on, Christianity was no longer purely the message of Jesus.

It became a state religion.

## Why Islam Came

Islam did not come to create a new religion.

Islam came to say:

"Return to the religion of Abraham."
"Return to the religion of Moses."
"Return to the religion of Jesus."

One God.
No partners.
No intermediaries.
No inherited sin.
No divine blood sacrifice.

Just:
- God
- You
- Accountability
- Mercy
- Repentance

The Quran says:

> "Say: We believe in Allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Moses, and Jesus… We make no distinction between them." (2:136)

Islam does not reject Jesus.
Islam protects him from being turned into something he never claimed to be.

## A Gentle Question for the Heart

Ask yourself honestly:

Did Jesus ever say:
"Worship me"?

Or did he say:
"Worship God"?

Did he pray to himself?
Or did he fall on his face and pray to God?

Did he say:
"I am God"?
Or did he say:
"My Father is greater than I"?

And if Jesus worshipped God…
Why shouldn't we?

## Islam Is Not a New Path — It Is the Original One

Islam means:
Submission to the One God.

Adam was Muslim.
Noah was Muslim.
Abraham was Muslim.
Moses was Muslim.
Jesus was Muslim.

Not by name.
But by submission.

Muhammad ﷺ came not to change this path —
but to restore it, protect it, and preserve it forever.

And this time, God promised:

> "Indeed, We have sent down the Reminder, and surely We will protect it." (15:9)

That is why the Quran remains unchanged.
That is why its message is clear.
That is why it speaks directly to the heart.

## Final Words — From Respect, Not Pressure

This is not a command.
This is not force.
This is not hate.

This is an invitation.

If you love Jesus,
If you believe in one God,
If you want the pure worship he taught,

Then Islam is not your enemy.

It is your home.

And the door is always open.
