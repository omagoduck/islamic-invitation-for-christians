## A Very Important Clarification

One of the biggest misunderstandings between Muslims and Christians is this:

Muslims do NOT believe the Bible is the Injil.

This is not an insult.
It is a historical and theological distinction.

The Injil was:
- A revelation from God
- Given directly to Jesus
- Spoken by him
- Pure guidance

The Gospels, on the other hand, are:
- Biographies written decades later
- Written by followers or followers of followers
- Written in Greek, not Jesus's language
- Compiled long after Jesus was gone

They are not the same thing.

## What the Injil Actually Was (According to Islam)

The Injil was:
- A divine message, like the Torah or the Quran
- Revealed to Jesus directly
- A continuation of the law of Moses
- Focused on worshiping One God
- A call to repentance and righteousness

It was not:
- A biography
- A philosophical text
- A theology book
- A story of crucifixion

It was guidance — spoken revelation.

## What Happened After Jesus Was Raised

After Jesus left this world, something critical happened:

There was no written Injil preserved.

His followers:
- Were persecuted
- Were scattered
- Had no political power
- Shared teachings orally

Decades passed.

Then, slowly, writings began to appear.

These writings:
- Were not written by Jesus
- Were not written in his language
- Were not reviewed or approved by him
- Often contradicted one another

Eventually, four of them were selected.

Matthew
Mark
Luke
John

These became what we now call The Gospels.

## A Historical Reality Many Don't Know

There were not just four gospels.

There were dozens.

Some portrayed Jesus as:
- A prophet
- A teacher
- A servant of God

Others portrayed him as divine.

So who decided which ones were "true"?

Not Jesus.
Not the disciples.
But church authorities — centuries later.

## The Council of Nicaea (325 CE)

This moment changed Christianity forever.

The Roman Emperor Constantine called a council.
The empire needed unity.
Religion was becoming political.

The question was:
Who is Jesus?

Two main beliefs existed:

Jesus is a servant of God

Jesus is divine and equal to God

The vote was taken.

The second view won.

The first view was declared heresy.

Books supporting the first view were burned.
Their followers were exiled or killed.
Their teachings disappeared.

This is not Islamic theory.
This is historical record.

## Why the Quran Rejects the Gospels as Divine Scripture

Islam does not say the Gospels are "fake."

It says:
They contain truth mixed with human words.

Some of Jesus' teachings remain.
Some were changed.
Some were added.
Some were misunderstood.

This is why the Quran says:

> "Woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, 'This is from God.'" (2:79)

Not to attack —
but to explain what happened.

## A Simple Example

Imagine this:

A teacher gives a speech.
No one records it.
Years later, students write what they remember.
Their memories differ.
Their interpretations differ.
Some add their own ideas.

Now imagine that writing becomes sacred.

That is what Islam believes happened with the Injil.

## Why the Quran Is Different

The Quran was preserved in a completely different way:

- Revealed publicly
- Memorized by thousands
- Written immediately
- Reviewed by the Prophet
- Standardized shortly after his death
- Preserved word-for-word

Not one verse has changed.

Not one chapter added.
Not one sentence removed.

This is why Muslims trust it completely.

## What Islam Says About the Bible Today

Islam does NOT say:

"The Bible is totally false."

Islam says:

- Some truth remains
- Some words were changed
- Some meanings were altered
- Some teachings were lost

This is why you will still find:
- Moral teachings
- Stories of prophets
- Calls to goodness

But also:
- Contradictions
- Confusion about God
- Conflicting accounts of Jesus

## The Quran's Role

The Quran describes itself as:

- A confirmation of previous scriptures
- A correction of distortions
- A final criterion

It does not erase the past.
It clarifies it.

## A Thoughtful Question

If Jesus truly brought a universal message…

Why was it written in multiple versions?
Why do the accounts disagree?
Why were books removed?
Why were beliefs voted into existence?

And if God wanted guidance preserved forever…

Would He not protect it?

Islam says:
He did.

## Closing of Part Four

Islam does not ask you to abandon Jesus.

It asks you to:
- See him as he truly was
- Free him from later theology
- Follow the God he worshipped

The Injil was light.
The Quran is its protection.

And the message has always been the same:

One God. One path. One truth.
