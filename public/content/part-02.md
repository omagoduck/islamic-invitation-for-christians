# Part Two: Jesus in the Qur'an — Who He Truly Was

## A Different Kind of Story

When people hear "Jesus in Islam," many imagine he is mentioned briefly or treated as a minor figure.

The truth is the opposite.

Jesus (Isa, peace be upon him) is one of the most honored human beings in the Qur'an.

- His name is mentioned 25 times
- An entire chapter is named after his mother — Surah Maryam
- His birth is described in more detail than in the Bible
- He is called a sign from God, a word from God, and a mercy

But the Qur'an tells his story differently — not to insult him, but to protect his true identity.

## The Birth of Jesus: A Miracle, Not a Deity

The Qur'an describes Mary (Maryam) as one of the purest women to ever live.

She was not a goddess.
She was not divine.
She was a devoted worshipper.

When the angel appeared to her and told her she would have a child, she was shocked:

> "How can I have a son when no man has touched me?" (19:20)

The angel replied:

> "This is easy for Allah." (19:21)

Jesus was born without a father, not because he was God — but because God wanted to show His power.

Just like:
- Adam was created without a father or mother
- Eve was created without a mother
- Jesus was created without a father

If being born without a father makes someone divine…
then Adam would be more divine than Jesus.

But Adam was a servant.
And so was Jesus.

## Jesus Speaks as a Baby — And What He Says Matters

One of the most powerful moments in the Qur'an is when baby Jesus speaks from the cradle.

He does not say:
"I am God."

He says:

> "Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet."
> (Qur'an 19:30)

This is critical.

His first words defend:
- God's oneness
- His own servanthood
- His role as a prophet

This moment alone defines the Islamic understanding of Jesus.

## What Jesus Taught, According to the Qur'an

Jesus' message in Islam is very clear:

**Worship One God**

**Obey God's commandments**

**Live righteously**

**Prepare for the next life**

The Qur'an quotes Jesus as saying:

> "Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is the straight path."
> (3:51)

This is the same message as:
- Abraham
- Moses
- Noah
- Muhammad

One God. One message. One path.

## Did Jesus Ever Claim to Be God?

The Qur'an answers this directly.

On the Day of Judgment, God will ask Jesus:

> "Did you say to the people: 'Take me and my mother as gods besides Allah'?"

And Jesus will reply:

> "Glory be to You! I could never say what I had no right to say… I only told them what You commanded me: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord."
> (5:116–117)

This verse is one of the strongest defenses of Jesus' innocence.

It shows:
- Jesus never claimed divinity
- Jesus never asked for worship
- Jesus will reject those claims himself

## The Crucifixion: What Islam Says Happened

This is where emotions run deep.

Christian belief:
Jesus died for sins.

Islamic belief:
God saved His prophet.

The Qur'an says:

> "They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him — but it was made to appear so to them."
> (4:157)

Islam does not say who was substituted.
It does not give details.
It simply states:

God protected His messenger.

Why?

Because prophets are not defeated.
They are not abandoned.
They complete their mission.

And Jesus' mission was not yet finished.

## The Return of Jesus

Here is something many Christians don't realize:

Islam believes Jesus will return.

Not symbolically.
Not spiritually.
Physically.

He will return near the end of time to:
- Defeat falsehood
- Break the cross (symbolically correcting false beliefs)
- Restore justice
- Confirm the truth of monotheism

And when he returns…

He will not return as God.
He will return as a servant of God.

## A Gentle Reflection

Ask yourself:

Why would God need to become human?
Why would God need to die?
Why would God need to be born, eat, sleep, or pray?

But a prophet?
A messenger?
A servant chosen by God?

That makes sense.
That fits history.
That fits reason.
That fits God's majesty.

## The Islamic Invitation (Not a Demand)

Islam does not say:
"Reject Jesus."

Islam says:
"Follow Jesus correctly."

Not as God.
Not as a sacrifice.
But as a prophet who called people to worship the One God.

The same God:
- Abraham worshipped
- Moses worshipped
- Jesus worshipped
- Muhammad worshipped

That God is One.

## Closing of Part Two

This is not about proving someone wrong.
This is about returning to clarity.

Islam does not erase Jesus.
Islam restores him.

And the invitation remains gentle, just as the Qur'an commands:

> "There is no compulsion in religion." (2:256)
