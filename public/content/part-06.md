# Part Six: Muhammad ﷺ Through the Lens of Jesus' Teachings

## A Question Many Christians Quietly Ask

If Jesus was a true prophet…
And if God sent prophets before him…
Then why would God stop sending guidance after Jesus?

This question matters.

Because throughout history, God always sent messengers when people drifted away from truth.

So the real question becomes:

If a final messenger came, what would he look like?

## What Jesus Said About the One to Come

In the Gospel of John, Jesus speaks about someone who will come after him:

> "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, to be with you forever."
> (John 14:16)

The Greek word used is Parakletos — often translated as "Comforter" or "Advocate."

Muslim scholars have long pointed out something important:

- The word can also be understood as Periklutos
- Meaning: "The Praised One"

And the name Muhammad literally means:
"The Praised One."

This does not mean Christians must accept this interpretation — but it explains why Muslims believe Jesus did predict Muhammad.

Especially because Jesus said:

> "He will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak." (John 16:13)

This matches exactly how the Quran describes revelation.

## How Muhammad Lived — and Why It Matters

Let's compare lives, not theology.

Muhammad ﷺ:

- Born among his people
- Known as truthful before prophethood
- Lived simply
- Married, had children
- Led a community
- Established law
- Prayed long hours
- Forgave enemies
- Never claimed divinity

Jesus (peace be upon him):

- Born among his people
- Known as righteous
- Lived simply
- Did not seek power
- Preached morality
- Prayed deeply
- Never claimed divinity

Their lives do not contradict.
They complement.

Both called to:
- Worship God
- Reject arrogance
- Live morally
- Prepare for the afterlife

## What Muhammad Actually Claimed

Muhammad never said:
"I am divine."
"I am the son of God."
"Worship me."

He said:
"I am only a servant of God and His messenger."

The Quran commands him to say:

> "I am only a human like you, to whom revelation has been given." (18:110)

If someone invents lies, they seek power.
If someone speaks truth, they remain humble.

Muhammad remained humble until death.

## Why Islam Needed a Final Messenger

By the time of Muhammad:

- Scriptures had been altered
- Prophets were being deified
- Religion had become political
- God's message was fragmented

Islam came to:
- Restore monotheism
- Unite previous messages
- Preserve revelation
- End confusion

And most importantly:
- Make the message universal

Jesus was sent to a people.
Muhammad was sent to humanity.

## What Jesus and Muhammad Agreed On

They agreed on:
- One God
- Prayer
- Charity
- Fasting
- Moral discipline
- Humility
- Accountability
- The Day of Judgment

They did not contradict each other.

What contradicted Jesus was later theology.

## The Character Test

One way to judge a messenger is by character.

Muhammad:
- Forgave enemies who tried to kill him
- Fed the poor
- Freed slaves
- Protected women
- Banned racism
- Lived simply
- Died with no wealth

Even his enemies called him:
"The Trustworthy One."

This matters.

False prophets seek power.
True prophets endure hardship.

## A Thoughtful Question

If Muhammad was lying…
Why would he live in poverty?
Why would he refuse wealth?
Why would he forgive enemies?
Why would he preach one God until death?

Liars seek comfort.
Prophets endure hardship.

## The Relationship Between Jesus and Muhammad

Islam does not place Muhammad above Jesus in value.

It places him after Jesus in time.

Like a teacher completing a lesson started by another teacher.

Not replacing.
Completing.

## Closing of Part Six

Islam does not ask you to abandon Jesus.

It asks you to recognize:
- His true role
- His true message
- His true mission

And to see Muhammad not as a rival —
but as the final voice in the same divine call.
