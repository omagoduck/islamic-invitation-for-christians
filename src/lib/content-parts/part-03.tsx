## A Moment That Changed History

Few events in human history are as emotionally powerful as the crucifixion of Jesus.

For Christians, it is the center of faith.
For Muslims, it is a moment of divine protection.
For historians, it is one of the most debated events ever recorded.

But to understand why Islam rejects the crucifixion, we must first step back and ask:

What kind of God do we believe in?

## The Islamic View of God's Justice

In Islam, God is:

- Perfectly just
- Completely powerful
- Free from human weakness
- Not dependent on sacrifice
- Not in need of blood to forgive

God does not require an innocent person to suffer so others may be forgiven.

The Qur'an repeatedly states:

> "No soul bears the burden of another." (6:164)

Each person is responsible for their own actions.
Forgiveness comes through repentance — not blood.

This principle is essential to understanding why Islam cannot accept the crucifixion narrative.

## What the Qur'an Actually Says

The Qur'an addresses the crucifixion clearly, but briefly:

> "They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him — but it was made to appear so to them."
> (Qur'an 4:157)

Notice what the verse does not say:

- It does not insult Jesus
- It does not mock Christians
- It does not explain details unnecessarily

It simply states:
Jesus was not killed.

And that statement alone changes everything.

## Why Would God Save Jesus?

In Islamic belief, every prophet sent by God has a mission.

Jesus' mission was:
- To remind people of God
- To correct corruption
- To prepare for the final messenger

That mission was not finished.

Jesus himself said (in the Bible):

> "I have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now."

Islam teaches that Jesus was saved because:
- He was innocent
- He had completed his role
- God does not abandon His messengers

Just as:
- Noah was saved from the flood
- Abraham was saved from the fire
- Moses was saved from Pharaoh

Jesus was saved from execution.

## "But Everyone Saw Him Crucified…"

This is where confusion begins.

The Qur'an says:

> "It was made to appear so to them."

This means:
- People believed they saw Jesus die
- But the reality was different
- God intervened in a way humans could not understand

The Qur'an does not explain how.
And that is intentional.

Because the message is not about how —
it is about who controls destiny.

God does.

## A Historical Question Many Avoid

Even among Christian scholars today, there are questions:

- Why do the Gospel accounts differ?
- Why do eyewitness accounts contradict each other?
- Why does Jesus sound uncertain on the cross?
- Why does he pray to God if he is God?

Some early Christian groups did not believe Jesus died.
These beliefs existed before Islam.

Islam did not invent this idea.
It preserved it.

## The Idea of Sacrifice — Does It Fit God's Justice?

This is one of the most important questions.

Christian doctrine says:
Jesus died for humanity's sins.

Islam asks:
Why would God need blood to forgive?

If God is all-powerful:
- He can forgive without sacrifice
- He can accept repentance directly
- He does not need a death to show mercy

In Islam:
Adam sinned.
Adam repented.
God forgave him.

No cross.
No blood.
No inherited sin.

Just mercy.

## The Concept of Original Sin — Rejected in Islam

Islam teaches:
- Every child is born pure
- No one inherits Adam's sin
- Everyone is accountable only for themselves

The idea that all humans are born sinful and need redemption through death contradicts divine justice in Islam.

God says:

> "Whoever does good, it is for himself. Whoever does evil, it is against himself." (41:46)

## The Return of Jesus: The Final Proof

Here is something deeply important:

Islam teaches that Jesus will return.

Why?

Because his mission was not completed.

When he returns:
- He will correct misunderstandings
- He will break false symbols
- He will restore monotheism
- He will rule with justice

And most importantly:

He will not return as God.

He will return as a servant of God.

This belief alone shows that Islam does not reject Jesus — it protects him from being misrepresented.

## A Quiet Question for the Heart

If Jesus truly died for sins…

Why would he need to return?

And if he returns…
Would he return as God?
Or as the servant of God?

Islam answers this clearly.

## The Meaning Behind It All

Islam does not deny Jesus.
Islam denies what people later claimed about Jesus.

Islam says:
- He was not abandoned
- He was not defeated
- He was not crucified
- He was not God

He was honored.
He was protected.
He was raised.
And he will return.

## Closing of Part Three

This is not about winning an argument.
This is about understanding truth calmly.

Islam does not come to erase Christianity.
It comes to explain what happened to it.

And it invites — never forces — people to return to the original message of all prophets:

Worship God alone.
Live righteously.
Prepare for the Hereafter.
