/**
 * This file is reserved for future runtime dynamic loading of content.
 * 
 * Currently, all content is loaded statically at once from @/lib/content.
 * If the content grows significantly and performance becomes an issue,
 * this file can be used to implement dynamic content loading on demand.
 * 
 * Potential implementation:
 * - Fetch content files dynamically based on partId
 * - Implement caching strategies
 * - Add lazy loading for better performance
 * - Support content updates without rebuild
